# Semantically Enriched Historical Data: Basel Oath of Peace Books

## Enhanced Semantic Analysis

### Introduction and Context
- **Vision for Scientific Data (2030)**: 
  - Aim: Seamless data integration and accessibility.
  - Focus: Invisible infrastructure, data as the primary resource.
- **Historical Data Characteristics**:
  - Nature: Complex, multi-layered, context-dependent.
  - Definition: Combination of static primary sources and dynamic secondary sources.
  - Representation: Graph form, linked with taxonomies/ontologies and dereferencing services.

### Semantical Enrichment of Historical Data
- **'Urfehdebücher der Stadt Basel'**:
  - Purpose: Illustrate semantical enrichment using semantic web technologies.
  - Scope: Primary source (Urfehdebücher) and secondary source (Digital Edition).
  - Goal: Transform data into self-sustaining infrastructure.
- **Project Implementation**:
  - Team: Led by Susanna Burghartz, University of Basel.
  - Technical Development: Centre for Information Modelling, University of Graz.
  - Approach: Experimental, student-supported, low-budget.

### Related Work and Comparative Analysis
- **Innovative Projects**:
  - Henry III Fine Rolls: Early integration of semantic web technologies with TEI transcription.
  - Sandrart.net: XML/TEI encoding with RDF Linked Open Data.
  - SYMOGIH and Semantic Blumenbach: Explorations in semantic web methods.
- **Comparison**:
  - 'The Proceedings of the Old Bailey': Similar approach but lacks RDF/SPARQL accessibility.
  - Projects' Limitation: Extended index approach insufficient for abstract concept analysis.

### The Digital Edition Workflow
- **GAMS Infrastructure**:
  - Functions: Administration, publication, preservation of digital resources.
  - Foundation: FEDORA-Commons, Cocoon-services, Blazegraph triplestore.
- **TEI Transcription to RDF Conversion**:
  - Process: Structuring text, marking phenomena, normalizing data.
  - Semantic Enrichment: TEI attribute 'ana' for global, multiple interpretations.
  - Transformation: XSLT-stylesheet for XML/RDF conversion, creating triples in triplestore.

### Results, Potentials, and Visualization
- **Functionalities and Outcomes**:
  - Search Capabilities: Fulltext and advanced search with SPARQL.
  - User Interactivity: Data basket for collection and export as CSV.
- **Visualization Techniques**:
  - Utilization of d3.js library for graph visualization.
  - Example: Analysis of 'Urfehdebuch' entries by category, gender, and punishment.

### Conclusion and Future Directions
- **Benefits of Semantic Web Data in Historical Research**:
  - Advantages: Enhanced data expressiveness, easy annotation, minimal programming.
  - RDF Dataset: Fundamental for online publication and advanced research queries.
- **Future Improvement**:
  - Data Model Alignment: With projects like the Old Bailey for standardization.
  - Vision: Establish common vocabulary and improve interoperability.
